            <h2>Overall Information</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Arrival Time for Race Day Pre-Ride Opportunities</strong> Please plan to arrive at least 20 minutes prior to your child’s pre-ride time to ensure he/she is prepared to ride (operable bike, race plate, jersey, etc.). If your child races in the morning (elementary and middle school groups), they can pre-ride the course with a coach from 8:30 to 9:30. If your child races in the afternoon (high school groups), they can pre-ride the course with a coach from 1:00 to 1:45.
                Also, help is always needed and appreciated to set up and break down the tents before and after the races.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Team tents:</strong> The three team tents will be located near the staging area.</p>
            <p><strong>Staging and Start Times </strong> Check either the  <a href = "https://virginiamtb.org/start-racing"> NICA</a> or <a href = "https://vahs-sports.com/schedule"> VAHS</a> websites to find the staging time for your rider(s). Based on a variety of factors from practice (technique, speed, fitness, etc.), your child’s coach will determine what order the riders line up for call-ups for the first race. The subsequent race orders are determined by points amassed in the previous race(s). Henrico will have a coach in the staging area during both the morning and afternoon races to ensure the riders are lined up correctly and ready for call-ups.    </p>

            <ul><strong>For the rider: </strong>

            <p><strong>Parking:</strong> Once you pass the guardhouse, you will be directed to park in a field on the left. You’ll pass a drop-off area for gear close to the team tents so take advantage of this if you have a lot to carry. However, it’s less than a 10 minute walk from your vehicle to the tent area.
                Please do not ride your bike across the track and soccer field that separates the parking area from the race tent area.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Food:</strong> There have not been food trucks at WFS for the past few seasons; as a result, besides bringing whatever food/drinks your group will enjoy, please be on the lookout for an on-line sign-up sheet on Heja for items to bring to the race for all to enjoy.

Since the race course crosses the main entrance road, if you are arriving Saturday, you will be directed to take a secondary entrance that will lead you past the Stokesville Lodge.  </p>
                <p><strong>Camping/Hotels :</strong> One of the many things that makes Stokesville such a great venue is the possibility to camp on-site since the racecourse weaves through the campground. The Stokesville sites go quickly when the race date is announced, so you need to make reservations quickly. However, camping is also available at Natural Chimneys Campground in the fall, which is located about 10 minutes away. If sleeping on the ground doesn’t appeal to you, there are numerous hotels in Staunton or Harrisonburg as well as Airbnb options nearby.

                    If your child races in the afternoon (high school groups), you will be directed to park either by the tennis courts or an adjacent lawn area. Your walk will be considerably shorter and flatter than the morning racers’ walk.

                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Miller School of Albemarle's course is a moderately technical 4-mile loop with a combination of gravel, grass, double track, and single track trails. It begins with a steep gravel road climb before going up a steep double track climb and then a  challenging singletrack climb. Yes, lots of climbing to start out the race--this means plenty of time and places to pass. 
                        Miller School’s iconic course introduces over 2 miles of diverse and exciting trails. The Cutaway Flyover, Puke Hill, and Super Dee are just a few of the additions which are sure to challenge even the most tactical of riders. 
                        The course goes back through central campus before looping through a grass to the finish line. The start and finish are in different locations. Lap times range between 14 minutes and 45 minutes.
